        "# 🏦 ATM Simulation Project\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to **Hasnain's Coding World**! This project simulates an ATM system that allows users to perform essential banking operations such as checking their balance, depositing money, withdrawing cash, and utilizing a convenient \"Fast Cash\" feature.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🚀 Features\n",
        "- **Check Balance**: View the current balance in your account.\n",
        "- **Deposit Money**: Add funds to your account with input validation to ensure accuracy.\n",
        "- **Withdraw Money**: Withdraw a specified amount, with checks for sufficient balance and valid input.\n",
        "- **Fast Cash**: Quickly withdraw predefined amounts ($1000, $5000, $8000, $10000) for convenience.\n",
        "- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling ensures a smooth user experience:\n",
        "  - Handles invalid menu choices.\n",
        "  - Prevents negative or zero deposits/withdrawals.\n",
        "  - Catches non-numeric input to avoid program crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🛠️ Technologies Used\n",
        "- **Python**: Core programming language for functionality.\n",
        "- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**: Used to structure the code efficiently with a class-based design.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 📖 Usage Instructions\n",
        "1. Run the program and follow the menu prompts.\n",
        "2. Select the desired operation by entering the corresponding number:\n",
        "    - `1`: Check your balance.\n",
        "    - `2`: Deposit money.\n",
        "    - `3`: Withdraw money.\n",
        "    - `4`: Use the Fast Cash option.\n",
        "    - `5`: Exit the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete each transaction.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🛡️ Error Handling & Validation\n",
        "- The program ensures input validation for all operations:\n",
        "  - Only numeric input is accepted for deposits and withdrawals.\n",
        "  - Withdrawals are allowed only if the balance is sufficient.\n",
        "  - Options outside the range of the menu prompt an error message.\n",
